## 📝 Objective
The main objective of this project was to create a fully functional, web-based calculator. The goal was to build a user-friendly interface that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using standard web technologies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For structuring the calculator interface and display screen.
* **CSS3:** For styling the buttons, layout, and adding responsive design/animations.
* **JavaScript:** For implementing the logic, button functionality, and calculation operations.
* **GitHub:** For version control and hosting.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1.  **Structure Design:** Created the HTML skeleton, defining the display area and a grid layout for the buttons (digits and operators).
2.  **Styling:** Applied CSS to make the calculator visually appealing, ensuring buttons have hover effects and the layout is centered.
3.  **Logic Implementation:** Wrote JavaScript functions to:
    * Capture button clicks.
    * Display input on the screen.
    * Evaluate mathematical expressions using the `eval()` function or custom logic.
    * Handle "Clear" (AC) and "Delete" (DEL) functionalities.
4.  **Testing:** Verified all operations (e.g., division by zero, decimal calculations) to ensure accuracy.
5.  **Hosting:** Deployed the project live using GitHub Pages.

## 🌟 Outcome
The final result is a responsive and interactive calculator application that works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. It successfully performs mathematical calculations with immediate feedback.
